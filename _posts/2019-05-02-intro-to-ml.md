ML models are a tool useful to establish a relationship or find patterns in the data. As it is wisely said, all models are wrong, only some are useful. The results from the models should always be verified to make sense from the business perspective.
ML is majorly divided into two types namely, **supervised and unsupervised learning**.

## Supervised Learning

These are models that have the outcome variable defined and the objective is to reach as close as possible to this outcome variable. These are of two types i.e. **Regression and Classification**. For this, we first define an error metric to help us with our cause. We will look into this later on.

Regression Models have continuous variable as outcome while classification Models have categorical variables as outcome.
