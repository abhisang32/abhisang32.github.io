Although knowing about various algorithms available is going to be very useful in coming up with the solutions but the process of model building involves much more than just agorithms. You need to have data in the usable format and with correct features for the model to give useful results. In fact, the data preprocessing takes up most of the time in model building.

## The Steps

The first step of any model building process has to be defining the objective. Once we know what our objective is, we have to work towards gathering the data needed to solve the problem at hand. For this purpose, one might need to setup a database to store the data. SQL generally comes in pretty handy for preprocessing data and getting it ready in the format to be analyzed. Now, we perform exploratory data analysis which includes univariate analysis, multivariate analysis and hypothesis testing
