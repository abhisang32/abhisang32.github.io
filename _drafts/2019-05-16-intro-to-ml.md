### What is Data Science 
Data Science is the field of science which allows us to extract meaning out of data. It started with statistics at its core and developed 
over time as we upgraded ourselves to store and analyze data. In recent times, there has been a significant surge in our capability 
to generate and store data, credits to social media. Based on the reports floating online, over 90% of the total data we have was 
created over last couple of years. 

### Machine Learning
Machine Learning is the branch of data science through which we go one step ahead from basic statistics and deal with predictions.
These predictions helps a machine learn on its own and execute tasks. In order to help these machines learn patterns in the data 
and generate meaningful insights, a whole lot of algorithms have been designed. We will discuss about these algorithms in the next post.

### Applications of Machine Learning
Today, you will find a team of data scientists in almost every other organization. Everyone is tring to leverage data in order to come 
up with insights that might help them grow their business. Machine Learning is used in almost every other domain be it healthcare, 
banking or agriculture. Businesses use it to decide their marketing strategies. Virtual Personal Assistants are already out in the 
market. Recommendation Systems are used to sell similar products to their customers and the list goes on.
