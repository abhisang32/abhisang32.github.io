### Output and Implementation

can be described in general as output for any classification algorithm giving probability outputs.
* probabilities
* Confusion Matrix
* Error Metrics - Misclassification Error, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
* AUC
* Lift and Gain Charts

### Variable Selection and Transformation

* IV and WOE

In case of Binary Outcome Variables, Weight of Evidence(WoE) helps us identify non linearity in continuous variables and 
Information value(IV) helps us choose variables that are important for prediciton.
