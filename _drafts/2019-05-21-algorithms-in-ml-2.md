Let's move onto Usupervised Learning now.

## Unsupervised Learning

These models do not have any outcome variables defined,rather, they are majorly used for segmenting data into unknown groups with similar characteristics. All the **Clustering Models** fall under this category. **Association Rules** and **Dimensionality Reduction** are also considered as Unsupervised Learning.

### Clustering

Clustering refers to dividing a population into multiple groups such that the the data points in the same group are more similar to each other than other groups.

1. K-Means Clustering

2. Hierarchical Clustering

### Association Rules

1. Apriori Algorithm

### Dimensionality Reduction

1. PCA

2. SVD

3. LDA

**Neural Networks**

Now that we have these out of the way, let's talk about Ensemble Learning
## Ensemble Learning

1. Bagging

2. Boosting
