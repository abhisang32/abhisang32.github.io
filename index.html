	<p> I am an IIT Kharagpur graduate and I work as a Data Scientist. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a> </p>

	<p>  Most of my theoritical learnings about data science has been through the amazing community out there and this is an effort
		of giving it back. Also, as they say, if you want to learn something, write about it. So, I will be writing about 
		machine learning in the <a href="/datascience">Data Science</a> section above. I will try to keep things as simple as possible. If you wish to 
		connect, Please reach out to me through below links. <br> <br> Drop me an <a href="mailto:abhisanghai32@gmail.com" title="abhisanghai32@gmail.com">email</a> if you wish to receive an alert for the blogs
		published.  </p>
